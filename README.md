# MLOps Workshop Repository

This repository contains the work completed during the [MLOps workshop](https://mlops.swiss-ai-center.ch/syllabus/) provided by the Swiss AI Center. The workshop offers a comprehensive guide to implementing Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) practices, covering the entire machine learning lifecycle from local experimentation to cloud deployment and continuous integration.

## Overview

The MLOps workshop is structured into four main parts, each focusing on a critical aspect of MLOps:

1. **Local Training and Model Evaluation**: Learn how to train a model locally and evaluate it using DVC.
2. **Move the Model to the Cloud**: Learn how to collaborate online using Git, a CI/CD pipeline, and CML.
3. **Serve and Deploy the Model**: Learn how to serve and deploy the model using BentoML and Docker.
4. **Labeling the Data and Retrain the Model**: Learn how to label new data and retrain the model using Label Studio.

Each part comprises several chapters that provide step-by-step instructions and practical exercises.
